# What is this project
[Decked out](https://youtu.be/u8-e5rfKUXw) is a game built by [TangoTek](https://www.youtube.com/@TangoTekLP) on [Hermitcraft season 7](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8t707flkqpf-LWYZw1LU7XtSL0as2OYG). Unfortunately, after official Hermitcraft 7 world download was published, Decked out **was not in a playable state**. So the main goal of this project is to do the proper maintenance and automate Decked out so that everyone can run this game at least 2000 times. Also i implemented some features that Tango wanted to do, but didn't.

# Requirements
+ One player (multiplayer is not supported)
+ Minecraft Java edition 1.16.4
+ **[optional]** Fabric mod + Carpet mod 1.16.5-1.4.44+v210714 (for fast-forwarding 5 minute clock)
+ **[optional]** Optifine mod 1.16.4 HD U G6 + Optifabric 1.13.16 (for increasing perfomance)
+ **[optional]** Replay mod 1.16.4-2.6.14 (for creating amazing videos or bug reporting)

# How to play
First - pick your version: i created two versions of Revival of Decked Out: **Tango version [download](https://github.com/Avtem/Revival-of-Decked-Out/releases/download/v.1.0.0_Tango/Revival.of.Decked.Out.Tango.version.rar)** and **Avtem version [download](https://github.com/Avtem/Revival-of-Decked-Out/releases/download/av_v.1.1.0/Revival-of-Decked-Out-av_v.1.1.0.rar)**.
They are very similar, but Avtem version has these additional features: 
```
Player gets random loot after submitting a set
The quest
Fixed soul seeker card implementation
Player no longer receives a reward card if they die
When game ends your deck is now *dispenced*
Trade in system: now accepting uniques and no longer accepting tier 2 cards
Fixed issue where clank is generated before player enters the dungeon
```

2. Install Minecraft version 1.16.4
1. **[optional]** Install Fabric 0.11.2 (for mods below)
4. **[optional]** Install mods above (or just download this [mods folder in zip](https://github.com/Avtem/Revival-of-Decked-Out/releases/download/mods/mods.rar) and delete mods you don't need)
5. Unpack downloaded Avtem or Tango version zip file in your saves folder
6. Enjoy!

## End goal
Since Revival of Decked Out is a single-player game, it would be nice to define for yourself an end goal that you beat the game. Here are my suggestions - pick one or more of them:
- Win 10 runs [easy]
- Collect 10 sets (you can submit one set multiple times) [easy]
- Punch all 21 soul flames during one run [medium]
- Bring 50 coins from the dungeon (single run, don't take coins before the run) [medium]
- Complete the quest [hard]
- Collect all 17 artifact sets [hard]
- Collect three cards from each Tier III [hard]

# Why did you create this project?
i trully love Decked Out with all my heart. While watching all his videos about building and running Decked Out 2 i thought "wait, it's not released yet, but there is Decked Out 1!". So i downloaded original Hermitcraft 7 world download and started the game. First two games were fun, but then all of the sudden game stopped working. i was very sad, so i tried to fix the game. After some investigation i found out that before world download the game wasn't prepared for viewers. There were so many things that made game unplayable! So i started investigating more and more and after that i decided that i want to fix this game and make it playable for everyone.
When playing original game i found out that shops aren't automated and that dungeon coins don't matter at all. About 45% of artifacts were simply gone in the system and only third of all compasses could be dropped for you before the start of the game. It means that you would never visit all compass drop locations!
With everything i've done i hope that coins *do* matter, you have a high desire to punch all soul flames and the auction brings a bit anticipation to you.
After finishing the project (verion 1.0.0) i played it about 200 times and had so much fun!
After releasing version 1.1.0 i really want to repeat that great journey again!

## AvVersion 1.1.0
Today, 24.03.2024 i released an update for my version. After beating Revival of Decked Out myself, i understood that it requires an update. The update is primarely focused on critical bug fixes and some general improvements for the player. Now game must be played in Adventure mode, but the only big difference is that you have to punch soul flames with Soul flame Punchificator. Please do not play version 1.0.0 as it has very serious bugs in it.
