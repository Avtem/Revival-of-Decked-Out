# What is this project
[Decked out](https://youtu.be/u8-e5rfKUXw) is a game built by [TangoTek](https://www.youtube.com/@TangoTekLP) on [Hermitcraft season 7](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8t707flkqpf-LWYZw1LU7XtSL0as2OYG). The main goal of this project is to take the original game from Hermitcraft 7 world download and make it **playable**. Also i implemented some features that Tango wanted to do, but didn't.

# Requirements
+ One player (multiplayer is not supported)
+ Minecraft Java edition 1.16.4
+ **[optional]** Fabric mod + Carpet mod 1.16.5-1.4.44+v210714 (for fast-forwarding 5 minute clock)
+ **[optional]** Optifine mod 1.16.4 HD U G6 + Optifabric 1.13.16 (for increasing perfomance)
+ **[optional]** Replay mod 1.16.4-2.6.14 (for creating amazing videos or bug reporting)

# How to play
First - pick your version: i created two versions of Revival of Decked Out: **Tango version [download](https://github.com/Avtem/Revival-of-Decked-Out/releases/download/v.1.0.0_Tango/Revival.of.Decked.Out.Tango.version.rar)** and **Avtem version [download](https://github.com/Avtem/Revival-of-Decked-Out/releases/download/v.1.0.0_Avtem/Revival.of.Decked.Out.Avtem.version.rar)**.
They are very similar, but Avtem version has these additional features: 
```
Player gets random loot after submitting a set
The quest
Fixed soul seeker card implementation (SSIII cards are too OP)
Player no longer receives a reward card if they die
When game ends your deck is now *dispenced*
Trade in system: now accepting uniques and no longer accepting tier 2 cards
Fixed issue where clank is generated before player enters the dungeon
```

2. Install Minecraft version 1.16.4
3. **[optional]** Install mods above (or just download this [mods folder in zip](https://github.com/Avtem/Revival-of-Decked-Out/releases/download/mods/mods.rar) and delete mods you don't need)
4. Unpack downloaded Avtem or Tango version zip file in your saves folder
5. Enjoy!
